# rockPaperScissorsApp

The rockpaperScissors App was solely built using vanilla javaScript and HTML. We have three main buttons which is use by the player to select either "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The computer uses the Math.random algorithm to create random numbers that is referenced to rockPaperScissors array to point and return either of the three items in the array("rock", "paper", "scissors").

Three functions were created which are the: the computerPlay(), playRound() and gameResult().
The computerPlay function defines the logic used by the computer to select an item from the rockPaperScissors array.
The playRound function defines the rules of the game between the player and the computer.
The gameResult function defines the logic used by the application to determine either the winner, looser or if it ended in a tie.
